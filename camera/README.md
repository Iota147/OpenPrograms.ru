## Developers
* Doob (a.k.a. Log)

## Description
This program draws an image, raytracing the terrain in front of the camera.

Entities can't be seen, that's the limitation of the camera.

Depending on the screen and graphics card tiers, you should launch the program differently:

* T3: `camera 0.041`
* T2: `camera 0.085`

As you might guess, the bigger the number, the more detailed the resulting image will be.

You can also provide `up` or `down` as the second argument if you're using the robot with the camera upgrade.

### Controls
* `Z` — zoom `+`.
* `C` — zoom `-`.
* `Backspace` — reset the zoom.
* `X` — switch the graphics mode.
* `Q` — quit.
