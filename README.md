# OpenPrograms.ru

This is a place for some programs that were posted on
[the Russian forums](http://computercraft.ru), and put here so that they can be
easily downloaded with `oppm`.

Go to the program directories to get the docs.

* `holo-editor` — Hologram Editor and Viewer.
* `lava-runner` — Lava Runner, a game.
* `libforms` — a lightweight GUI library.
* `mc` — a file commander.
* `obj` — a 3D model render library for OpenGlasses.
* `geomine` — a miner program that uses a geolyzer to mine the ores efficiently.
* `geoglasses` — a program that searches for ores and highlights them on glasses
  from the OpenGlasses mod.
* `camera` — a program that draws what the Computronics' camera sees.
* `libthread` — an easy-to-use multithreading library.
* `libqr` — a QR code generator library.
* `libvector` — a vector library.

If you experience any bugs with the programs or want to request a feature,
feel free to leave an issue on the issue tracker, or poke me on EsperNet.
I'll contact authors of the programs and try to get a response from them ASAP.

I also try to keep the programs up-to-date with the original version.
